        <h3>The MathJax Sponsorship Program</h3>
        <p>The MathJax project was initiated in 2009 by Design Science, the American Mathematical Society (AMS) and the Society
          for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) with the goal of creating a robust, easy-to-use, and universal solution
          for displaying high-quality mathematics online. From the beginning, MathJax was conceived as open-source software,
          on the principle that math display should be part of the common infrastructure of the web.</p>
        <p>Providing a universal solution for online math display requires a long-term commitment. Our users need MathJax to
          be reliable and easy to use, now and in the future. This requires a continuous and coordinated rapid response to
          browser updates and bugs, keeping up with the proliferation of tablets, smartphones, and ebook readers, and a consistent
          approach towards new functionality and performance improvements. All of this is important to the community, and
          requires dedicated time, effort and money.</p>
        <p>Our founding sponsors have been very generous in providing funding. However, as more and more individuals and organizations
          are using MathJax and its benefit to the community is growing, its base of support grew via the Sponsorship Program.
          To ensure the long-term stability of MathJax, we continuously reach out to the community and ask organizations
          to contribute to the MathJax project by becoming a
          <a href="#friends">Friend</a>,
          <a href="#supporters">Supporter</a>, or
          <a href="#partners">Partner</a>.
          <strong> All MathJax sponsors share a demonstrated and significant interest in the dissemination of mathematics on the web,
            in particular through the MathJax project and its activities.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Please feel free to
          <a href="mailto:info@mathjax.org">contact us</a> for any further information about the sponsorship program.</p>
        <h3>MathJax Friends</h3>
        <p>By becoming a MathJax Friend, organizations show the community that they support the goal of easy-to-use, high-quality
          mathematics display on the web for everyone, and are contributing in a very concrete way to help MathJax realize
          that goal. MathJax Friends will be listed on the MathJax Sponsors page.</p>
